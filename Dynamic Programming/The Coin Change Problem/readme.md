You have m types of coins available in infinite quantities where the value of each coin is given in the array C = [c0, c1, ..c_{m-1}]. Can you determine the number of ways of making change for n units using the given types of coins?

Given N, M, and C, print the number of ways to make change for N units using any number of coins having the values given in C.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of n and m. 
The second line contains m space-separated integers describing the respective values of c0, c1..c_{m-1} (the list of distinct coins available in infinite amounts).

Output Format

Print a long integer denoting the number of ways we can get a sum of n from the given infinite supply of m types of coins.
