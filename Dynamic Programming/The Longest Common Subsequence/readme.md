A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Longest common subsequence (LCS) of 2 sequences is a subsequence, with maximal length, which is common to both the sequences. 

Given two sequence of integers, A= [a1, a2,..an]  and B= [b1, b2..bm], find any one longest common subsequence.

In case multiple solutions exist, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one non-empty common subsequence will exist.


Input Format

First line contains two space separated integers, n and m, where n is the size of sequence A, while m is size of sequence B. In next line there are n space separated integers representing sequence A, and in third line there are m space separated integers representing sequence B.

Output Format

Print the longest common subsequence and each element should be separated by at least one white-space. In case of multiple answers, print any one of them.
