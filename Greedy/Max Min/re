Given a list of N integers, your task is to select K integers from the list such that its unfairness is minimized.

if (x_1, x_2, ..,x_k) are K numbers selected from the list N, the unfairness is defined as
max(x_1, x_2, ..x_k) - min(x_1, x_2,..,x_k)

where max denotes the largest integer among the elements of K, and min denotes the smallest integer among the elements of K.

Note: Integers in the N list may not be unique.
