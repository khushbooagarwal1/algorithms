Given two arrays A  and B, check if you can construct new array C, where each C[i] = A[i]  or C[i] = B[i], and is a non decreasing sequence.

Input Format

First line contains T, the number of test cases. In each test case first line contains N, length of arrays A and B. Next two lines contains array A and B respectively.

Output Format

For every test case print "YES" , if a non decreasing sequence can be constructed, else print "NO".
