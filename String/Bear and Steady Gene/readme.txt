A gene is represented as a string of length n (where  is divisible by 4), composed of the letters A, G, T, and c. It is considered to be steady if each of the four letters occurs exactly n/4 times. For example, AGTC and AAGGCTTC are both steady genes.

Bear Limak is a famous biotechnology scientist who specializes in modifying bear DNA to make it steady. Right now, he is examining a gene represented as a string s. It is not necessarily steady. Fortunately, Limak can choose one (maybe empty) substring of s  and replace it with any string of the same length.

Modifying a large substring of bear genes can be dangerous. Given a string s, can you help Limak find the length of the smallest possible substring that he can replace to make s a steady gene?

Note: A substring of a string S is a subsequence made up of zero or more consecutive characters of s.
