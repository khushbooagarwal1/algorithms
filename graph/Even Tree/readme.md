You are given a tree (a simple connected graph with no cycles). The tree has N nodes numbered from 1 to N and is rooted at node 1.

Find the maximum number of edges you can remove from the tree to get a forest such that each connected component of the forest contains an even number of nodes.

Input Format

The first line of input contains two integers N and M. N is the number of nodes, and M is the number of edges. 
The next  lines contain two integers u and v which specifies an edge of the tree.

Constraints
2 <= N <= 100
Note: The tree in the input will be such that it can always be decomposed into components containing an even number of nodes.

Output Format

Print the number of removed edges.
